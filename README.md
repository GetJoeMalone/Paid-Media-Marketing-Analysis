# Paid Media Marketing Analysis by Joe Malone

The purpose of this project is to simulate the skills that might be needed to do a robust analysis of paid media marketing.

Since it is not always possible to get all data from one source, the first part of this project revolves around finding various datsets with different information that could be useful.
Those datasets are prepped and cleaned then a master dataset is created for analysis.
